# netflix-troubleshooting-guide

In this document I will try to help the user which is having issues while trying to use Netflix.
1. Is the TV on? Does it have power? There is power electricity in the house?
2. Try to turn it off and back on using the remote controller. This will reset the TV and will also test the RC.
3. Do you know if the TV is connected to internet via cable or using Wi-fi? If you don't know just check in the back of the TV if you see a wire similar to the phone ones, that will mean that is connected via cable. Can you follow that wire, it may end in the Router. Check if the connections are ok by pushing a bit back on the cable.
4. Let's now check the Router. Check if the Router is turned on, if not, try to find the power button and press it. If it doesn't turn on, check the power cord, if it's correcly connected to both sides, the router and the electricity.
5. From your phone which is connected via Wi-fi try to navigate to any web page. This will test the wi-fi connection to internet via the router.
6. Let's try to check if the TV has internet access. Find the browser in the menu of the TV. Try to make a search in google. If this works we know that we TV has connection to internet.
7. In the RC find the "Netflix" button, this will open Netflix application in the TV. Check if you are signed in, if not do so using your credentials. 
8. Let's try to see a Movie, using the RC, select any movie and click play. If it doesn't work we then know that the issue might be in the Netflix Service.
